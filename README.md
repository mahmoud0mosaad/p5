##  Project Overview
#   Objective
The primary goal of this project was to build an interactive dashboard using HR Analytics data to visualize and analyze key human resource metrics. This dashboard provides insights into employee demographics, turnover rates, performance, salary analysis, and more. It aims to inform the organization about trends and areas that need attention for improving employee retention, performance, and overall satisfaction.
## KPIS Overview
Total Employees: 1,470
Total Turnover: 237 employees (16%)
Current Employees: 1,233 employees
Average Monthly Income: 6,500 USD
Average Age: 36.5 years

#  Data Understanding and Exploration
Employee Information: Age, gender, marital status, distance from home.
HR Metrics: Monthly income, performance rating, engagement score, work-life balance, training times.
Turnover Indicator: Whether the employee has left the organization.
Satisfaction Levels: Environment satisfaction and relationship satisfaction.
Initial Data Cleaning and Exploration:
Data was pre-processed by handling missing values, normalizing categories (e.g., marital status, gender), and converting data types as needed.
We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to investigate relationships between features, such as turnover, performance, salary, and satisfaction scores.

Lowest-Paying Roles:
Research Scientist, Laboratory Technician, and Sales Representative were among the lowest-paid positions.
#  Marital Status and Turnover
The majority of the workforce was married, while the majority of those who left the company were single. This finding suggests that single employees may be more likely to leave, potentially due to different work-life priorities.
#  Distance from Home
Turnover Employees: The average distance from home for employees who left the company was 10.36 km.
Current Employees: The average distance from home for current employees was 8.92 km, indicating that longer commutes could correlate with a higher chance of turnover.
#  Performance, Salary, and Training
Performance and Salary: Employees with higher performance ratings had higher monthly incomes, indicating that performance is rewarded with better compensation.
Training and Performance: Employees who participated in more training sessions showed improved performance. This suggests the importance of continuous professional development to boost employee performance.
#  Work-Life Balance and Satisfaction
Work-Life Balance: Employees who rated their work-life balance higher also reported greater environment and relationship satisfaction. This highlights the importance of balancing work demands with personal life to improve overall employee happiness.

##  Conclusion
Key Business Recommendations
Focus on Younger Employees (18-35 Age Group):The turnover rate is highest in this age group. 
Tailored programs to increase engagement and retention for younger employees, such as career development plans, might reduce the high turnover.
Address Turnover Among Single Employees: Since most of the turnover comes from single employees, consider offering work-life balance perks and engagement activities tailored to this demographic.
Invest in Training Programs: The data shows that increased training leads to improved performance. Expanding training programs could boost overall productivity and employee satisfaction, which in turn reduces turnover.
Offer Flexible Work Arrangements: Employees with long commutes are more likely to leave. Introducing remote work options or flexible hours could help retain employees who live far from the office.
Reward Performance With Competitive Compensation: The relationship between higher performance ratings and better salary indicates that rewarding high performance can incentivize employees. Ensure that high performers are recognized and adequately compensated.
